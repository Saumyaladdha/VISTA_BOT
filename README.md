CHAT WITH MODEL
This Colab interface enables users to interact with a chatbot by selecting from models like mixtral-8x7b-32768, llama2-70b-4096, or gemma-7b-it, adjusting memory length, and submitting questions. It also includes functionality to clear inputs and view responses, leveraging the ChatGroq API for AI-driven conversations and memory management with ConversationBufferWindowMemory.

CHAT WITH DOC
script processes PDF documents to extract text and set up a vector store using FAISS for semantic search. It utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, where the vector store indexes text chunks, and a language model (via ChatGroq) generates responses based on user queries. The ConversationalRetrievalChain integrates the retrieval and generation components to handle user interactions effectively.

AI BASED VOICE ASSISTANT
script uses the Groq API with the llama3-70b-8192 model to generate text responses based on user input. The gTTS library converts the generated text into speech, which is then played automatically. Widgets from ipywidgets create an interactive interface where users can input text, generate responses, and hear them spoken aloud.

MP4/MP3 TO TEXT/AUDIO QUESTION
script sets up an interactive interface for processing audio files and generating responses based on user queries. It performs the following steps:
Audio Processing: Users upload audio files, which are split into chunks for transcription. Each chunk is then transcribed into text using the Groq API. Text Processing and Search: The transcribed text is split into smaller chunks and indexed using FAISS. Users can then query this index to find relevant text segments, which are used to generate answers to their questions through the Groq chat completion API. Interface and Output: The script uses widgets to manage file uploads, prompt inputs, and responses. The generated responses are converted to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and played back to the user.

YOUTUBE URL
This script provides a complete workflow for processing YouTube videos into text transcripts. It downloads audio from a YouTube URL using yt-dlp, splits the audio into chunks, transcribes each chunk (mock implementation), and stores the combined transcript in a GROQ database. Users can input the URL, chunk size, and a query to interact with the stored transcript through an IPython widget interface.

ML GUIDANCE
This script provides an interactive interface using IPython widgets to facilitate the creation of a machine learning project. Users select a model, upload a dataset, and describe their problem. The script then uses predefined agents to clarify the problem, assess the data, recommend models, and generate starter code, orchestrating these tasks through the Crew framework and displaying the results.

AUDIO LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR
This code sets up an interactive audio translation interface using IPython widgets. Users can upload a WAV audio file, which is then transcribed to text using speech recognition. The transcribed text is subsequently translated into the selected language using the Groq API, with the translated text displayed in the output area.
